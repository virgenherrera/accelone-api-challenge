#  Accelone API Challenge

## Description

This is Hugo Virgen's answer to the following [Code Challenge.](./instructions.pdf)

## Tech stack

- Node.js
- Nestjs.
- Swagger.

## API endpoints

- POST /contacts
- GET /contacts/:id
- PUT /contacts/:id
- DELETE /contacts/:id

##  Project Scripts

__start__: This script starts the application using NestJS. It launches the server and prepares it to handle incoming requests.

```bash
npm run start
```

__test__: This script runs all tests, including unit tests and end-to-end tests, and then builds the project. It ensures that all tests are executed before the project is built, verifying the integrity of the code.

```bash
npm run test
```

Once you have started the application using the start script, you can check the Swagger API documentation. Open your web browser and navigate to /api to view the interactive API documentation provided by Swagger. This allows you to explore and test the different endpoints available in the application.

## Postman Collection

To access the Postman collection, you can [click here](./postman-collection/accelone-api-challenge.postman_collection.json). This will allow you to download or view the collection directly in Postman, making it easier to test and interact with the API endpoints.
